# CCNA-Networking-Labs
CCNA Networking Labs
This repository contains a collection of hands-on networking labs designed to reinforce key concepts from the CCNA (Cisco Certified Network Associate) curriculum. These labs cover essential topics such as LAN switching, VLANs, IPv4/IPv6 addressing, Spanning Tree Protocol (STP), troubleshooting static routes, and more.

Each lab includes detailed configurations, topology diagrams, and step-by-step instructions to help learners practice and develop a strong understanding of networking fundamentals.

**Lab Topics**

1. Configuring Spanning Tree – Learn to configure and verify Spanning Tree Protocol (STP) to prevent network loops and ensure redundancy.
2. DTP & VTP – Explore Dynamic Trunking Protocol (DTP) and VLAN Trunking Protocol (VTP) for VLAN management in a multi-switch environment.
3. Ethernet LAN Switching – Understand switching fundamentals, MAC address tables, and frame forwarding mechanisms.
4. IPv4 Addressing – Configure and verify IPv4 addressing, subnetting, and default gateway settings.
5. IPv6 Configuration – Implement and troubleshoot IPv6 addressing, link-local addresses, and static/dynamic routing.
6. OSI Model – Practical exercises to map networking components and protocols to the OSI reference model layers.
7. SSH Configuration – Secure device access by configuring Secure Shell (SSH) for encrypted remote management.
8. Troubleshooting Static Routes – Identify and resolve common issues with static routing misconfigurations.
9. VLANs – Configure Virtual LANs (VLANs) to segment network traffic and improve security and efficiency.
10. VLSM (Variable Length Subnet Masking) – Optimize IP address allocation using subnetting techniques for efficient network design.
11. 
**Requirements**
Cisco Packet Tracer or GNS3 for network simulation
Basic knowledge of Cisco CLI commands
Understanding of fundamental networking concepts
