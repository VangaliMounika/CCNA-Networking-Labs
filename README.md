# CCNA-Networking-Labs
CCNA Networking Labs
This repository contains a collection of hands-on networking labs designed to reinforce key concepts from the CCNA (Cisco Certified Network Associate) curriculum. These labs cover essential topics such as LAN switching, VLANs, IPv4/IPv6 addressing, Spanning Tree Protocol (STP), troubleshooting static routes, and more.

Each lab includes detailed configurations, topology diagrams, and step-by-step instructions to help learners practice and develop a strong understanding of networking fundamentals.

Lab Topics
Configuring Spanning Tree – Learn to configure and verify Spanning Tree Protocol (STP) to prevent network loops and ensure redundancy.
DTP & VTP – Explore Dynamic Trunking Protocol (DTP) and VLAN Trunking Protocol (VTP) for VLAN management in a multi-switch environment.
Ethernet LAN Switching – Understand switching fundamentals, MAC address tables, and frame forwarding mechanisms.
IPv4 Addressing – Configure and verify IPv4 addressing, subnetting, and default gateway settings.
IPv6 Configuration – Implement and troubleshoot IPv6 addressing, link-local addresses, and static/dynamic routing.
OSI Model – Practical exercises to map networking components and protocols to the OSI reference model layers.
SSH Configuration – Secure device access by configuring Secure Shell (SSH) for encrypted remote management.
Troubleshooting Static Routes – Identify and resolve common issues with static routing misconfigurations.
VLANs – Configure Virtual LANs (VLANs) to segment network traffic and improve security and efficiency.
VLSM (Variable Length Subnet Masking) – Optimize IP address allocation using subnetting techniques for efficient network design.
Requirements
Cisco Packet Tracer or GNS3 for network simulation
Basic knowledge of Cisco CLI commands
Understanding of fundamental networking concepts
